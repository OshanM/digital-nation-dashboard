# Digital Readiness Assessment
A tool to provide rapid, high-level insights into a country's digital strengths and weaknesses. Intended as an "entry point" for increased engagement between governments, UNDP country offices, and a broad range of digital transformation experts. Through the lens of UNDP's Inclusive Whole-of-Society Digital Transformation Framework.

# Inclusive Digital Data Repository
Combining public international data sets on inclusive digital transformation with local country data sets

# Digital Nation Dashboard 
Leverages the Data Repository to visualize the digital state of the nation, allowing for comparisons against other countries, Region, Sub-Region, Intermediate-Region,Categories (eg SIDS, LDC, LLDC), Income level. It's also important to track progress over time and whether a country is improving or getting worse (and how dramatically). Within each country, data sets should be visualized in a way to tell the story of that data. For instance, showing a map of coverage of 4G data connectivity overlaid with population to identify gaps, or showing mobile data penetration differences between genders vs as a part of the whole population.

# Inspiration
State of the Octoverse: how might we show a country's stats? Eg size of community. Gender breakdown. Main languages. Key packages. Types of protects. YOY change. Contributions to open source.   https://octoverse.github.com/
<br>
Would be great to understand per country: Open Source for Good projects, user types (teachers, government, designers), top languages, top repos, % of work on national projects vs international, activity rate, % of repos using code with vulnerabilties, gender breakdown of users, % of active repos relying on open source
